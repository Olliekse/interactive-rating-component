##### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

###### What I learned

- basic HTML structure of a web page, using <head>, <body>, <footer>
- using "absolute" positioning of page elements
- CSS to put elements into position using flexbox, with margins and/or padding
- creating a Javascript function to show and hide different containers, as well as to use the 'textContent' of one element in another place
- :hover psuedo-class
  
###### Continued development

- I'd like to make the Javascript transition smoother and more interesting
- Add a "comment" box for users to fill in (optionally) after submitting the number rating
